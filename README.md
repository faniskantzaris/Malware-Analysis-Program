# Malware Analysis Program

The Malware Analysis Program is a comprehensive tool designed to facilitate the detection of malware in files. This program integrates a user-friendly graphical interface with a powerful backend using YARA rules for identifying malicious code patterns. The combination of a Flask web server and a Tkinter-based GUI provides flexibility and ease of use, making it suitable for both novice and advanced users in the cybersecurity domain.

## Features

1. **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**
   - **File Upload and Scan:** Users can easily upload files and initiate scans directly from the GUI.
   - **Visual Feedback:** The program provides clear visual feedback on the scan status and results, enhancing user experience.
   - **Full-Screen Mode:** The application runs in full-screen mode, ensuring all functionalities are easily accessible.
   - **Exit Button:** Allows users to safely exit the application at any time.

2. **Backend Functionality:**
   - **YARA Rules Integration:** Utilizes YARA rules to detect known malware patterns in files.
   - **SHA-256 Hash Calculation:** Computes the SHA-256 hash of files for additional integrity and malware checks.
   - **File Handling:** Efficiently handles file uploads and ensures temporary files are properly deleted after scanning.
   - **Flask Web Server:** The Flask server facilitates web-based file uploads and scanning, making the program accessible over a network.

3. **Multi-threading:**
   - **Concurrent Execution:** The program runs the Flask server and the GUI concurrently using multi-threading, ensuring a responsive user experience.
